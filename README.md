## ðŸ‘‹  Welcome to My Profile!


Hi there! I'm a robotics engineer with a Master's degree from AAU Denmark, specializing in control theory. My passion for mathematics and engineering has driven me to focus on developing advanced solutions in robotics. I have experience in designing Non-Linear Model Predictive Controllers and working with different robotics-related software such as ROS2, PyTorch, SciKit, OpenCV, and Acados.
